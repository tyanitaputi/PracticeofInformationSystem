      "The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place  \n",
      ". The jury further said in term end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves  \n",
      "the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury  \n",
      "had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won  \n",
      "by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the  \n",
      "widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . The jury said it did find that  \n",
      "many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act ``  \n",
      "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a number of  \n",
      "other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which  \n",
      "inure to the best interest of both governments '' . However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to  \n",
      "achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced  \n",
      "clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem .  \n",
      "Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds  \n",
      "and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . The grand jury took a swipe at  \n",
      "the State Welfare Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . `` This is one of the major  \n",
      "items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute  \n",
      "these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this  \n",
      "money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .  \n",
      "Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said .  \n",
      "`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary  \n",
      "'s court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and  \n",
      "compensation . The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries ,  \n",
      "the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court 's  \n",
      "wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar  \n",
      "airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate  \n",
      "political influences '' . The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of  \n",
      "the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . On other matters , the jury recommended that : Four additional deputies be  \n",
      "employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail  \n",
      "'' . Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension  \n",
      "plan for city employes . The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner 's Office ,  \n",
      "the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his  \n",
      "wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . His petition charged mental cruelty . The couple was married Aug. 2 ,  \n",
      "1913 . They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin . Attorneys for the  \n",
      "mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as `` attorney '' and his  \n",
      "age as 71 . It listed his wife 's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. . The petition said that  \n",
      "the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd.  \n",
