            "by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the  \n",
            "widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . The jury said it did find that  \n",
            "many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act ``  \n",
            "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a number of  \n",

            "money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .  \n",
            "Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said .  \n",

            "wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar  \n",
            "airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate  \n",

            "employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail  \n",
            "'' . Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension  \n",
